Sometimes I dream about reality
Sometimes I feel so down
Sometimes I fall into insanity
Sometimes I feel so lonesome
Sometimes I dream about the wild wild world
Sometimes I see Freedom
Tonight I watch through my window
And I can't see no lights, no
Sometimes I dream about fraternity
Sometimes I say one day...
One day my dreams will be reality, yeeh
Like Bobby said to me
Eh Mr Marley... seems something good to me
This world go crazy... it's an emergency!
Eh Bob Marley... eh Bob Marley
This world go crazy...
